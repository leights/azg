azg
===

azg contains scripts enabling genomic workloads to run more 
easily on the Azure Cloud VM.  Our  initial focus is to provide 
simple mechanisms that provisions a small cluster of Linux VMs 
to run a genomics pipeline that takes Illumina reads (.fastq) 
and produces a variant called genome (.vcf) as output.

After this is working reasonably well, we will review what
else we want to do.

The scripts are available so you can easily modify the install 
procedure to suit your specific needs in bio tools, vm sizes,
and cluster requirements.  

have fun.
